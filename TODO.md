This TODO list is automatically generated from the cookiecutter-cpp-project template.
The following tasks need to be done to get a fully working project:


* Push to your remote repository for the first time by doing `git push origin main`.
* Make sure that the following software is installed on your computer:
  * A C++-17-compliant C++ compiler
  * CMake `>= 3.9`
* Enable the integration with `codecov.io` by heading to the [Codecov.io Website](https://codecov.io),
  log in (e.g. with your Github credentials) and enable integration for your repository. This will
  allow you to have automatic coverage reports on pull requests, but is not necessary to display
  the coverage badge in the README.
